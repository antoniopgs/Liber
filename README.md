## Introduction:
History has proven time and time again that only authoritarianism can create the type of circumstances out of which the greatest of Human Suffering is born. Economic Stagnation, Censorship, Starvation, Genocides, Slavery, Concentration Camps and Pointless Wars all stem from forceful manipulation and infrigements upon Individual Liberty.

History has also proven however, that humanity's greatest golden ages are byproducts of liberty. The Athenian Democracy (freedom to choose one's rulers), The Renaissance, The Enlightenment (freedom to use rational thought), America (life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness) were all based on Individual Liberty.

There are many supporters of Individual Liberty, but unfortunately they are drowned out admist economically blind socialists or dogmatic conservatives.
It is pointless to try to reason with unreasonable individuals.  For long we have tried to explain the value of true Liberty, to no avail. They "rationalize" every failure of Collectivism as a problem of execution, instead of recognizing the problem resides in their values.
No amount of debate, argument or reasoning will change their minds.  The only thing that will change their minds is reality. A new reality, that must rise from better principles and show (not merely tell) the world about the true value of Liberty.
It is therefore imperative to found a new nation based on Individual Liberty.

## On the Redistribution of Wealth
At first, many countries implemented capitalist democracies with small welfare states. They believed they could "find a reasonable middle ground" between the left and the right:
1. Now Democracy (by its own definition) is the rule of the majority.
2. The majority (by its own definition) is not a successful or exceptional demographic. It's average, at best.
3. **This means that the demographic who controls a nation's Capitalism and Freedom (the average majority) has it in its rational self-interest to constantly vote for more and more welfare, the exact thing that kills them.**

No matter how small the welfare state of a capitalist democracy, the powerful majority will eventually always push for its expansion.  This is what leads to ridiculous taxes. This is what leads to ridiculous government spending.

> "The difference between a welfare state and a totalitarian state is a matter of time." - Ayn Rand

**I believe that unless the redistribution of wealth is made to be constitutionally illegal, a nation's freedom shall only be temporary, never permanent.**

*"How can you maintain a state without redistribution of wealth? No society would survive without taxes."*

This question leads to the next topic...

## Taxes:
*"How can you maintain a state without redistribution of wealth? No society would survive without taxes."*

It's actually quite simple. You make taxes optional.

*"Optional taxes would never work. Everyone would just choose not to pay them."*

That's almost true. Yes, if given the option almost nobody would pay for social security, public healthcare, etc.
However, if through tax payments, you gave people the ultimate incentive, they would most certainly pay them.

*"What is the ultimate incentive?"*

Their rights.  
If you needed to pay taxes to have freedom of speech, the right to a fair trial, access to the police, and the right to own property, wouldn't you pay them?  
Also, in a free society, isn't protecting individuals from force the only role of government?  
If I don't pay my taxes, what right do I have to the protection of police officers or the effort of judges?  
**Granting Rights through taxation is the only rational, pragmatic and fair way to maintain a state without fiscal force ("fair" given that the price of citizenship should be the same for all individuals, regardless of their wealth).**

The implementation of this will be called the **Citizenship Contract**:
- Only citizens of Liber shall have rights.
- To attain citizenship, one only needs to pay the Citizenship Contract.
- The Citizenship Contract shall be the only form of taxation, and include within itself only the necessary cost to support a minimal and essencial government.
- The Citizenship Contract shall be available to all individuals.
- The Citizenship Contract shall grant access to all Constitutional Rights.
- The Citizenship Contract will grant citizenship for 1 year, and every individual is free to renew his citizenship.
- Maybe a Visitor Contract could also be implemented. It would grant rights for shorter periods of time. (Will think more about this later on).

This would have several benefits:
1. No Fiscal Authority (like an IRS) would be needed.
2. The Tax paying process would be simpler. The Citizenship Contract payment could be done directly from each citizen to a governmental blockchain address (more on this later).
3. **Because of benefits 1 and 2, the size of goverment would be drastically reduced. This means less money would be necessary to maintain it, which would reduce even further the cost of the Citizenship Contract.**

## Currency:
Previous Seasteading attempts have tried to implement their own currency (see Republic of Minerva).  
This is a huge obstacle. Not only do you need to find the material and processes needed to manufacture the new currency, you will also have to somehow make it valuable within the international economy. Nobody will want to join a nation whose official currency is worthless in the global economy.

Luckily, Cryptocurrencies have several advantages over National Currency, completely removing the need for the latter:
- Cryptocurrencies empower individuals to store and transfer value in a decentralized, private and secure manner. This would make forced taxation much harder, further protecting one from financial tyranny (yet another reason to adopt voluntary taxation).
- Cryptocurrencies exist within their own competitive market. Allowing Liber's citizens to transact in whatever currency they choose will allow them to also evolve along with this technology. Liber's citizens will be able to constantly move to faster, safer and more capable cryptocurrencies, allowing free market competition to reward the best implementations, and placing Liber at the forefront of one of the world's most important technologies.
- Cryptocurrencies eliminate the need for a Central Banking system, along with all of its complications (bigger government, becoming a possible gateway for international money laundering, etc.)
- Cryptocurrencies will better position the finances of Liber's residents in the international cyberspace.
- There are already many companies, apps and wallets ready to allow easy P2P Cryptocurrency transfers (Revolut, Circle, BitPay, Coinbase Commerce, Metamask, etc.)

Although Liber will not need any official currency, there will need to be some sort of standard for taxation.  
The optimal solution would be to declare a certain asset as a standard for the Citizenship Contract. As the Citizenship Contract would be renewed yearly, it's value (and the currency it's paid in) could be easily adjusted, as long as citizenship price is equal to all individuals in a given year.  
For example, the Citizenship Contract could be 3 ETH for 2021 and 2 ETH for 2022 (as the value of Ether changes). Or instead of ETH, Liber could still decide to tax Citizenship in dollars or euros, but paid through Bitcoin.
The payments will be made to a governmental cryptocurrency address, which increases safety and transparency, decreasing corruption.  
*(Need to think further about what standard Liber should use for its taxes.)*
  
## A Hybrid Legal System:
Throughout History, many free nations have evolved to authoritarian regimes, through the progressive destruction of their constitution/legal code.
Therefore, the Political Ideology of Conservatism was born. Conservatives wish to preserve laws, values and tradition, for the sake of protecting freedom.
While they come from a good place, a law should not be preseved merely for how long it's been around. It should be preserved only on the basis of it's inherent value.

This leads to a dillema:
- On one hand, making the law unchangeable will protect constitutional freedoms but it also limits a nation's ability to adapt and evolve.
- On the other hand, allowing the law to change allows a nation to adapt and evolve but it also opens the door for the destruction of constitutional freedoms.

How do we protect consitutional freedoms (eliminate the downside), while also enabling progress via tinkering and trial and error (allow the upside)?
The answer is in Nassim Taleb's notion of Antifragility and in his Barbell Strategy.

Taleb defines the Antifragile as that which improves from stressors, as opposed to Fragile things (who are worsened by stressors), or even Robust things (who are not affected by stressors).
One can easily think of Fragile or Robust things, like a Wine Glass or a Piece of Iron, respectively.
It is harder to find examples of Antifragility, as they are more often found in complex systems (like the overall industry of Aviation, who improves when one of its competitors makes a mistake).
To create an Antifragile Investment Strategy, Taleb developed the Barbell Strategy where:
- 90% of investments are very safe (to eliminate the downside)
- 10% of investments are very risky (to allow for upside)

One could take inspiration from this philosophy to protect Liber's downside (and make sure individuals will never lose their rights), but also leaving Liber open to upside (let citizens vote on greyer areas of the Non Agression Principle like overfishing, carbon emission costs, etc.)
Therefore, the optimal solution will be to have two legal documents:
  - One of them immutable and everlasting, to forever ensure the protection of each individual's rights (The Constitution).
  - One of them mutable, where citizens can vote on issues like overfishing and carbon emission costs (The Legal Board).

### The Constitution:
1. This consitution shall forever remain unchanged.
2. All amendments hereby presented will only be granted to citizens. Only citizens of Liber shall have constitutional rights.
3. An individual shall only attain citizenship through a yearly voluntary contract established with the goverment of Liber. Through this contract, an individual can pay the goverment of Liber, and in return attain constitutional rights.
4. The price of citizenship may change over time, but if it does, it must change equally for all citizens. All citizens must pay the same price for citizenship on a given year, regardless of their wealth.
5. No citizen shall be forced to pay another individual, group, entity, organization or the government. There shall never be forced Redistribution of Wealth.
6. There shall be no infringement upon a citizen's freedom of speech, religion, peaceful assembly or petition to the government.
7. The right of each citizen to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed upon.
8. The right of each citizen to own and totally control his property shall not be infringed upon.
9. No citizen, group, entity or organization shall receive any form of payment/bailout/government funding.
10. No citizen shall be imprisoned or penalized for anything other than infringing upon another citizen's rights.

*(Will refine this, just a first sketch. Note: Another valuable point of Taleb is Silver Rule > Golden Rule. Many disasters were caused by agents who believe to be doing the right thing. In the legal system for the world's first truly free society, individuals should not be told what they are allowed to do. They should be told what they are not allowed to do (via negativa). This will also allow to make the laws clearer, more objective and less ambiguous)*

### The Legal Board:
- In the year of 2021, Liber's citizens voted that the carbon emmision costs will be X per CO2 ton.
- In the year of 2021, Liber's citizens outlawed fishing over X tons of fish Y over the course of the year.

*(Will refine these examples, just a first sketch...)*

## Structure:
Liber will possess a minimal goverment. It's only function will be to enforce the Non Agression Principle protection for all it's citizens (Citizenship Contract paying individuals). To enforce the NAP, the following institutions will be needed:
- Military (protect citizens from foreign force)
- Police (protect citizens from other individuals)
- Prisons (protect and isolate citizens from individuals incapable of following the NAP)
- Courts (guarantee and uphold each citizen's Constitutional Rights)

## Main Previous Pitfalls
From reading Patri Friedman's Practical Guide to Seasteading, one can conclude that the main reasons for failure are:
 - Unrealistic Ambitions and Over-Complication.
 - Bad Location Choice
 
### Unrealistic Ambitions and Over-Complication
Patri Friedman presents two options:
 - "High Road" Seasteading (high capital, host country partnership seasteading) - his admitted preference.
 - "Low Road" Seasteading (low capital, do it yourself seasteading)

The High Road might sound attractive, but it brings many complications:
 - Harder to convince investors (It will be hard enough to raise capital for the world's first startup nation, even more so if it's a large capital endeavour.
 - Increased dependance, which means it must be closer to other Nations. In previous attempts, seasteads were placed very close to territorial waters. On one hand, this makes infrastucture transport and commerce easier. On the other, these neighbour nations may interfere, as they've done in the past (Chad & Nadia vs Thailand).

Some countries may even grant Charter City permits at first, but how long would they keep their hands off of a nearby, more prosperous, but military inferior nation?
What if the next elected leader is more of an authoritarian? What if a regime change happens?

Is it that hard to conceive of a nation interfering and claiming Liber as it's sovereignty? It has happened before.

The freedom of the new world should not be staked on the whims of other nations. Therefore it will be better to be far way, in deep international waters.
 
Also regarding over-complication, there are many technologies like Seacreate and OTEC generators that may seem like good options, but they are unproven or immature at best.  
The Seasteading Insitute also shares received proposals for space platform seasteads, underwater seasteads and all kinds of impractical ideas.

It will be better to found Liber with simpler, more proven technologies, and let Liber's freedom generate these new ideas with time.  
Patri seems to present the "High Road" and "Low Road" as mutually exclusive, but I disagree. If Romulus didn't start small, Rome wouldn't exist.  
It is perfectly reasonable to start on the Low Road and gradually transition to the High Road.  
If freedom has proven anything over time, is its capacity to generate growth and prosperity.  

After the first settlers (remote working pioneers, engineers, etc.), it would be reasonable to attract the spearfishing community, to bring in individuals capable of generating self sustenance and surplus, which they could then trade with the rest of the settlers, easily establishing Liber's first businesses.  
From this, the natural progression could be to bring in chefs, cooks and food workers to establish the first floating Restaurant/Establishment/Food Business. It could be supplied by Spearfishermen and used by remote workers. Then cleaning staff, etc.  
Singapore and Hong Kong grew very fast. In an even freer society, I estimate that it would take less than 5 years for Liber to become a first world country.

Unless the process is simplified, nothing will ever get done. Better to start small and grow, than to start too big and crash. Romulus > Icarus.  
The time is now.
 
### Location

Another key element that will help to attract businesses and invidivuals will be location. Liber will need:
- Stability (Calm Waters, Low Winds, No Hurricanes/Tornadoes/Cyclones/Typhoons)
- Weather (Pleasant, attractive, sunny weather that will also help Energetic Self Sufficiency - Solar)
- Food (Plentiful, warm waters. Seastead infrastructure will also serve as reef and increase amount of fish)
- Safety (Away from Piracy and Authoritarian Governments)
- Relevance (Close to major trade routes)

Rough waters are mostly caused by transversal winds.  
In contrast, the calmest and most stable waters are found in the areas where air converges (and moves up) or diverges (and moves down).

These can be found on places like The Doldrums, Horse Latitudes, and Sub-Polar Low Pressure Belts as shown below:
![Image of Atmospheric Circulation](/atmospheric_circulation.jpg)

First, we exclude the Sub-Polar Low Pressure Belts, as they are far too cold. We are left with the Doldrums and the Horse Latitudes.

The main difference between the Doldrums and the Horse Latitudes is the atmospheric humidity.
Compared to the Doldrums, the Horse Latitudes have a drier atmosphere, which causes more a pleasant temperature, less clouds, higher sun exposure (greater potencial for solar) and fewer storms, tornadoes and the like.

We are now left to choose between the Northern or Southern Substropical High Pressure Belt, as shown below:
![Image of Atmospheric Circulation](/horse_latitudes.jpg)

Both options already give us Stable Waters with Good Weather and Strong Biodiversity.
The next selections will be based on Safety and Relevance.

The natural enemies of Liber will be Collectivist Nations with Authoritarian Governments. The first that come to mind are China and Russia.
Therefore, placing Liber in the Pacific Ocean is a risky move. One could argue that it could be placed closer to California, but it's a collectivist state, and who knows what may happen to the nation's leadership in the coming decades.

The next to be eliminated is the Indian Ocean. Although it is not as easily accesible to China or Russia, it is still surronded by non trustworthy nations (like Thailand, who already blocked a previous Seasteading Attempt). Piracy is also much more prevalent in the Indian Ocean.

This leaves us with the Atlantic Ocean. Namely between:
 - The North Atlantic High (or Azores High)
 - The South Atlantic High (or St. Helena High)
 
Compared to the South Atlantic (which is near places like Brazil and Western Africa) the North Atlantic High will place Liber:
 - Smack dab in the Heart of Western Civilization, between Western Europe and the world's bastion of freedom, the United States of America.
 - In the heart of one of the most (if not the most) important trade routes in the world.
 - In a place where the closest territory are the Azores, a small and autonomous region of Portugal which also embraces freedom. The Azores motto: "Rather die free than subjected in peace".
 
***The North Atlantic High has Stable Waters, Good Weather, Food, Safety and Relevance. It is the perfect womb for the new world.***

---------------------------------------- UNDER CONSTRUCTION ----------------------------------------

## Potential Threats Liber Might Pose
Liber (by its own nature) will obviously present a threat to politicians, bureaucrats and authoritarian governments.
However, one must also be aware of threats like being an exhile for international criminals.
Therefore, only individuals with no criminal past will be allowed to move to Liber.

Morally and ethically Liber should legalize all drugs. However, this might present itself as an easy excuse for goverments to attack it.
This should be taken into account when deciding on Liber's Location.

## Laws vs Rulers
Lorem Ipsum.

## Conclusions:
 - Liber will be a nation founded on individual liberty.
 - Liber will be governed by Laws, not people.
 - Liber will have a Hybrid Legal System, with two sets of laws:
   - The Constitution (permanent and unmodifiable)
   - The Legal Board (everchanging and modifiable).
  
Next Steps: Show this to Joe and Patri. Engage with the Objectivist and Minarchist Communities and turn this into a worldwide document. Talk with companies like Ocean Builders and figure out how to deploy their homes in the high seas. Assess costs, timelines, etc. Evaluate interest from spearfishermen and engineers.
  
Other thoughts:
 - To bundle or not bundle taxes? Should citizens have the option to only pay for courts, for instance? Probably not, but will need to think further on this...
 - Could Blockchain provide solid proof of identity mechanisms and enable decentralized democratic processes? Will need to investigate. Identity would probably be attached to the Citizenship Contract...
