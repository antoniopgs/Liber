# Liber

**Description:** Sovereign City State Seastead
**Name:** Liber (Free)
**Motto:** Lex, Logos, Libertas (Law, Reason, Liberty)

**Introduction:**

History has proven time and time again that only authoritarianism can create the type of circumstances out of which the greatest of Human Suffering is born. Genocide, Slavery, Concentration Camps, Rape and Pointless Wars all stem from forceful manipulation and infrigement of individual liberty.
History has also proven that the greatest ages of humanity have all derived from liberty. The Athenian Democracy (freedom to choose one's rulers), The Renaissance, The Enlightenment (freedom to use rational thought), America (life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness) were all based on bottom-up individuality and freedom.
  
**Conclusions:**
 - Liber will be a nation based on liberty, both on the economic and lifestyle aspects.
 - Liber will be governed by Laws, not people.
 - Liber will have two sets of laws:
  - The Constitution (permanent and unmodifiable)
  - The ??? (everchanging and modifiable).

**Constitution:**
1. This consitution shall forever remain unchanged.
2. All of the rights in this constitution will be granted by citizenship. Citizenship will only be granted by a willing and voluntary contract established by the government and each citizen
3. The price of citizenship may change, but if it does, it must change equally for all citizens. All citizens must pay the same price for citizenship, regardless of their wealth.
2. There shall be no infringement upon a citizen's freedom of speech, religion, peaceful assembly or petition.
3. The right of each citizen to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed upon.

**Needs:**
- Stability (Calm Waters, Low Winds, No Hurricanes/Tornadoes/Cyclones/Typhoons)
- Energy (Locations with high Sunlight Exposure)
- Food (Seastead infrastructure might increase amount of fish)
- Safety (Away from Piracy, Authoritarian Governments, and the right to bear arms)

**Structure:**
 - Minimal Goverment with 3 functions:
  - Military
  - Police
  - Courts
  
**Currency & Taxation:**

With the advent of Cryptocurrencies and Blockchain Technology, Liber will not need any official currency.
However this will make taxation much harder, to due to decentralized and private nature of cryptocurrencies.
So instead of a mandatory taxation system, Liber will simply attach each citizen's rights to his/her taxes.
In order to have property rights, access to a fair trial, etc. One must pay taxes.
