**Introduction:**

History has proven time and time again that only authoritarianism can create the type of circumstances out of which the greatest of Human Suffering is born. Genocide, Slavery, Concentration Camps, Rape and Pointless Wars all stem from forceful manipulation and infrigement of individual liberty.
History has also proven that the greatest ages of humanity have all derived from liberty. The Athenian Democracy (freedom to choose one's rulers), The Renaissance, The Enlightenment (freedom to use rational thought), America (life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness) were all based on bottom-up individuality and freedom.
  
**Conclusions:**
 - Liber will be a nation based on liberty, both on the economic and lifestyle aspects.
 - Liber will be governed by Laws, not people.
 - Liber will have two sets of laws:
  - The Constitution (permanent and unmodifiable)
  - The Legal Board (everchanging and modifiable).

**Constitution:**
1. This consitution shall forever remain unchanged.
2. All amendments hereby presented will only be granted to citizens. An individual shall only attain citizenship through a mutual, consensual, willing and voluntary contract established between the government and each citizen to be.
3. No citizen shall ever be forced to pay another individual, group, entity, organization or government.
3. The price of citizenship may change, but if it does, it must change equally for all citizens. All citizens must pay the same price for citizenship, regardless of their wealth.
2. There shall be no infringement upon a citizen's freedom of speech, religion, peaceful assembly or petition.
3. The right of each citizen to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed upon.
4. The right of each citizen to own property shall not be infringed upon.
4. No citizen, group, entity or organization shall receive any form of payment/funding/bailout by the government.
5. No citizen shall be imprisoned/penalized for anything other than infringement of another's rights.

**Needs:**
- Stability (Calm Waters, Low Winds, No Hurricanes/Tornadoes/Cyclones/Typhoons)
- Energy (Locations with high Sunlight Exposure)
- Food (Seastead infrastructure might increase amount of fish)
- Safety (Away from Piracy, Authoritarian Governments, and the right to bear arms)

**Structure:**
 - Minimal Goverment with 3 functions:
  - Military
  - Police
  - Courts
  
**Currency & Taxation:**

With the advent of Cryptocurrencies and Blockchain Technology, Liber will not need any official currency. There are P2P Cryptocurrency Payment Apps that will allow decentralized payments.
However this will make taxation much harder, to due to decentralized and private nature of cryptocurrencies.
So instead of a mandatory taxation system, Liber will simply attach each citizen's rights to his/her taxes.
In order to have property rights, access to a fair trial, etc. One must pay taxes.
This is the most fair and pragmatic way to solve the tax problem. It will also make the need for fiscal authority obsolete, further diminishing governamental needs, and consequently the amount of required taxes for citizenship.


There are many technologies like Seacreate and OTEC generators. They may seem like good options, but they are unproven or immature at best.
It will be better to found Liber with simpler, more proven technologies, and let Liber's freedom generate these new ideas with time.
Unless the process is simplified, no private funding will ever be received. Better to start small and grow, than to dream too big and fail.
By reading Patri Freidman's Practical Guide to Seasteading, one can conclude that the main reason for failure are unrealistic ambitions and over-complication.

Liber (by its own nature) will obviously present a threat to politicians, bureaucrats and authoritarian governments.
However, one must also be aware of threats like being an exhile for international criminals.
Therefore, only individuals with no criminal past will be allowed to move to Liber.

Morally and ethically Liber should legalize all drugs. However, this might present itself as an easy excuse for goverments to attack it.
This should be taken into account when deciding on Liber's Location.
