## Introduction:
History has proven time and time again that only authoritarianism can create the type of circumstances out of which the greatest of Human Suffering is born. Economic Stagnation, Censorship, Starvation, Genocides, Slavery, Concentration Camps and Pointless Wars all stem from forceful manipulation and infrigements upon Individual Liberty.

History has also proven however, that humanity's greatest golden ages are byproducts of liberty. The Athenian Democracy (freedom to choose one's rulers), The Renaissance, The Enlightenment (freedom to use rational thought), America (life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness) were all based on Individual Liberty.

There are many supporters of Individual Liberty, but unfortunately they are drowned out admist economically blind socialists or dogmatic conservatives.
It is pointless to try to reason with unreasonable individuals. For long we have tried to explain the value of true Liberty, to no avail.
No amount of debate, arguments or reasoning will change their minds. The only thing that will change their minds is reality. A new reality, that will rise from better principles and show (not merely tell) the world about the true value of Liberty.
It is therefore imperative to found a new nation based on Individual Liberty.

## On the Redistribution of Wealth
At first, many countries implemented capitalist democracies with small welfare states. They believed they could "find a reasonable middle ground" between the left and the right:
1. Now Democracy (by its own definition) is the rule of the majority.
2. The majority (by its own definition) is not a successful or exceptional demographic. It's average, at best.
3. **This means that the people who control your nation's Capitalism and Freedom (the average majority) have it in their rational self-interest to constantly push for more and more welfare, the exact thing that kills them.**

No matter how small the welfare state of a capitalist democracy, the powerful majority will eventually always push for itss expansion.
This is what leads to ridiculous taxes. This is what leads to ridiculous government spending.

> "The difference between a welfare state and a totalitarian state is a matter of time." - Ayn Rand

**I believe that unless the redistribution of wealth is made to be constitutionally illegal, a nation's freedom shall only be temporary, never permanent.**

*"How can you maintain a state without redistribution of wealth? No society would survive without taxes."*
This question leads to the next topic...

## Taxes:
*"How can you maintain a state without redistribution of wealth? No society would survive without taxes."*
It's actually quite simple. You make taxes optional.

*Optional taxes would never work. Everyone would just choose not to pay them.*
That's almost true. Yes, if given the option almost nobody would pay for social security, public healthcare, etc.
However, if through tax payments, you gave people the ultimate incentive, they would most certainly pay them.

*"What is the ultimate incentive?"*
Their rights.
If you needed to pay taxes to have freedom of speech, the right to a fair trial, access to the police, and the right to own property wouldn't you pay them?
Also, didn't we just conclude that in a truly free society, that should be the only governmental role? To protect individuals from force?
If I don't pay my taxes, what right do I have to the protection of police officers or the labor or judges?
**Granting Rights through taxation is the only rational, pragmatic and fair way to maintain a state without fiscal force ("fair" given that the price of citizenship should be the same for all individuals, regardless of their wealth).**
  
## Conclusions:
 - Liber will be a nation founded on individual liberty.
 - Liber will be governed by Laws, not people.
 - Liber will have a Hybrid Legal System, with two sets of laws:
  - The Constitution (permanent and unmodifiable)
  - The Legal Board (everchanging and modifiable).
  
## A Hybrid Legal System:
Many free nations have evolved to authoritarian regimes, through the progressive destruction of their constitution/legal code.
Therefore, the Political Ideology of Conservatism appeared. Conservatives wish to preserve laws, values and tradition, for the sake of protecting freedom.
While they come from a good place, a law should not be preseved merely for how long it's been around. It should be preserved only on the basis of it's value.
However, this opens up a country's law to change, and therefore to the threat of legal decay.
Following Nassim Taleb's notion of Antifragility and the Barbell Strategy, one will want to protect Liber's downside (and make sure individuals will never lose their rights), but also leaving Liber open to upside (let citizens vote on greyer areas of the NAP principle like overfishing, carbon emissions, etc.)
The optimal solution is to have two legal documents:
  - One of them immutable and everlasting, that forever ensure's the protection of each individual's rights (The Constitution).
  - One of them mutable, where citizens can vote on issues like overfishing, carbon emissions, etc (The Legal Board).

## Constitution:
1. This consitution shall forever remain unchanged.
2. All amendments hereby presented will only be granted to citizens. Only citizens of Liber will have constitutional rights.
3. An individual shall only attain citizenship through a yearly voluntary contract established with the goverment of Liber. Through this contract, an individual can pay the goverment of Liber, and in return attain constitutional rights.
4. The price of citizenship may change over time, but if it does, it must change equally for all citizens. All citizens must pay the same price for citizenship on a given year, regardless of their wealth.
5. No citizen shall be forced to pay another individual, group, entity, organization or the government. There shall never be Government enforced Redistribution of Wealth.
6. There shall be no infringement upon a citizen's freedom of speech, religion, peaceful assembly or petition to the government.
7. The right of each citizen to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed upon.
8. The right of each citizen to own and totally control his property shall not be infringed upon.
9. No citizen, group, entity or organization shall receive any form of payment/bailout/government funding.
10. No citizen shall be imprisoned or penalized for anything other than infringing upon another citizen's rights.

## Structure:
Liber will possess a minimal goverment. It's only function will be to enforce the Non Agression Principle protection for all it's citizens (tax paying individuals). To enforce the NAP, the following institutions will be needed:
- Military (protect citizens from foreign force)
- Police (protect citizens from other individuals)
- Prisons (protect and isolate citizens from individuals incapable of following the NAP)
- Courts (guarantee and uphold each citizen's rights)

## Currency & Taxation:
Currency and Taxation are major topics when creating a new society:

### Currency:
Previous Seasteading attempts have tried to implement their own currency (see Republic of Minerva). This is a huge obstacle. Not only do you need to find material and processes to manufacture the new currency, you will also have to make it valuable within the international economy. Nobody will want to join a nation where the official currency is worthless in the grand scheme of things.
Happily, the arrival of Cryptocurrencies completely removes the need for a national currency.
Not only do Cryptocurrencies allow decentralized and secure storage and transfer of value, they also exist within their own market of competition. Allowing Liber's citizens to transact in whatever currency they choose will allow the nation to evolve along with this technology. Liber's citizens will be free to constantly move to faster, safer and more capable cryptocurrencies, allowing free market competition to reward the best implementations, and placing Liber at the forefront of one of the world's most important technologies.
The usage of Cryptocurrencies will also eliminate the need for a national banking system, along with all its complications (bigger goverment size in the financial sector, becoming a possible gateway for international money laundering, etc.)
Lastly, the free adoption of Cryptocurrencies will also better position the finances of Liber's residents in the international cyberspace.
There are already many companies, apps and wallets which allow easy P2P Cryptocurrency transfers (Revolut, Circle, BitPay, Coinbase Commerce, Metamask, etc.)

### Taxation:
The adoption of cryptocurrencies however, will make forced taxation much harder, due to their decentralized, secure and private nature.
Therefore, instead of a mandatory taxation system, Liber will simply attach each individual's citizenship to his/her taxes.
In order to have Constitutional Rights, one must hold citizenship. In order to attain citizenship, one must pay the Citizenship Tax.
The Citizenship Tax will be the only form of taxation and will grant access to all Constitutional Rights.
This is the simple, rational and pragmatic way to solve the tax problem.
It will also make the need for fiscal authority obsolete, further diminishing governamental needs, and consequently the amount of required taxes for citizenship.

Although Liber will not need any official currency, there will need to be some sort of standard for taxation.
The optimal solution would be to pick some cryptocurrency and make it a standard. As the Citizenship Tax will be a renewable yearly contract, it's value (and the currency it's paid in) could be easily adjusted, as long as citizenship is equal to all individuals in a given year.
For example, the Citizenship Tax could be 3 ETH for 2021 and 2 ETH for 2022 (as the value of Ether changes). Or instead of ETH, Liber could decide to tax Citizenship in BTC, LINK, XMR, etc.
The payments will be made to a governmental cryptocurrency address, which increases safety, transparency and decreases corruption.
*P.S. (Need to think further about what standard Liber should use for it's taxes.)*

## Main Previous Pitfalls
There are many technologies like Seacreate and OTEC generators. They may seem like good options, but they are unproven or immature at best.
It will be better to found Liber with simpler, more proven technologies, and let Liber's freedom generate these new ideas with time.
Unless the process is simplified, no private funding will ever be received. Better to start small and grow, than to dream too big and fail.
By reading Patri Freidman's Practical Guide to Seasteading, one can conclude that the main reason for failure are:
 - Unrealistic Ambitions and Over-Complication.
 - Bad Location choice
 
## Location
- Stability (Calm Waters, Low Winds, No Hurricanes/Tornadoes/Cyclones/Typhoons)
- Energy (Locations with high Sunlight Exposure)
- Food (Seastead infrastructure might increase amount of fish)
- Safety (Away from Piracy, Authoritarian Governments, and the right to bear arms)

Liber will need to be located in calm waters and away from authoritarian regimes. 
These can be found on The Doldrums or on the Horse Latitudes.
Compared to the Doldrums, the Horse Latitudes have more pleasant temperature, drier air, less clouds, higher sun exposure (greater potencial for solar), and less prevalence for storms, tornadoes and the like.
The ideal location for Liber will therefore be in the Horse Latitudes or Subtropical Highs.
In previous attempts, seasteads were placed very close to territorial waters. On one hand, this makes infrastucture transport and commerce easier. But it also means the higher likelihood that any given nation will interfere and claim Liber as it's sovereignty. Therefore it will be better to be far way, in deep international waters.
The options are North Atlantic, South Atlantic, North Pacific, South Pacific and the southern Indian Ocean.
The North and South Pacific are not protected enough from China, the southern indian isn't protected enough from piracy and it's closer to countries who previously stifled seasteading attempts. The South Atlantic could be advantageous due to the proximity to drug cartels, but these are unpredictable.
The best location will therefore be the North Atlantic Subtropical High. In the heart of western civilization, between The United States of America and Western Europe, this will place Liber in calm waters, good weather, away from piracy, away from major authoritarian regimes and in the heart of important international commerce routes.

## Potential Threats Liber Might Pose
Liber (by its own nature) will obviously present a threat to politicians, bureaucrats and authoritarian governments.
However, one must also be aware of threats like being an exhile for international criminals.
Therefore, only individuals with no criminal past will be allowed to move to Liber.

Morally and ethically Liber should legalize all drugs. However, this might present itself as an easy excuse for goverments to attack it.
This should be taken into account when deciding on Liber's Location.
